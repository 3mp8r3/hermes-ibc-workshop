# Hermes IBC Workshop

## Introduction

In this workshop we will be working with the [Hermes IBC Relayer](https://hermes.informal.systems) in order to transfer fungible tokens ([ics-020](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-020-fungible-token-transfer)) between two [Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport) custom [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) chains.

This repository contains all the instructions if you want to run the workshop in your local computer. Please follow the step-by-step instructions below to complete the workshop.

The main goal of putting up this workshop is to allow users to better understand the IBC protocol and how packets are relayed from one chain to another using the IBC primitives (client, connections, channels, ports, and packets).

This workshop will be presented at the [HackAtom RU](https://hackatom-ru.devpost.com/) by [Andy Nogueira](https://github.com/andynog) from [Informal Systems](https://informal.systems).
